The Investopedia Paper Stock Simulator has a 15-minute delay in displaying real-time stock values on its website. Due to this delay, users can identify ticker symbols that experienced the most growth within the past 15 minutes. This program provides information on the stock that has grown the most during this timeframe, this allow users to generate consistent positive returns.

**To do:**
- Implement investopedia api so that the program will trade automatically
- Add more ticker symbols to the program


**FAQs:**
Why won't the program run???
  - The program will only run during trading hours. This means the code will not run on trading holidays as well.

Why will the program not return values?
  - This is because the values are dependant on the yfinance api, sometimes the api is unable to return data and that ticker symbol is not considered.


If there are any issues feel free to let me know.

Let me know if there are improvements that I can make. 

P.S this is my first real python project

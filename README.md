Investopedia Paper Stock Simulator has a 15 minute delay between real time stock values and values that are displayed on the website. This will allow us to take advantage of this time delay and exploit it. This program will return the stock that grew the most in the past 15 minutes allowing you to always make trades that will give you profit.
